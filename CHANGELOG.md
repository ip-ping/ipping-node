# Changelog

Progress log for `ipping-node`, newest first. Each entry is one small, tested step.

## Unreleased

### 2026-11-04: destination policy
- Allowlist of globally routable unicast addresses; IANA special-purpose IPv4 and IPv6 ranges,
  multicast, and ranges that embed an IPv4 address (NAT64, 6to4, Teredo, IPv4-mapped) are refused.
- Strict literal parsing (no `127.1`, hex, scoped or `host:port` forms) and hostname validation.
- The node re-checks every target even though the backend already did.

### 2026-11-04: crate skeleton and protocol types
- Cargo project (edition 2024), CI (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests), MIT license, plan in README.
- Protocol v1 frame types, with tests that parse every example frame from the backend's
  `contracts/fixtures/` and require node frames to round-trip byte-for-byte.
